3)To create your Artifactory server instance, add the following line to your script:
def server = Artifactory.server 'my-server-id

If your Artifactory is not defined in Jenkins you can still create it as follows:

def server = Artifactory.newServer url: 'artifactory-url', username: 'username', password: 'password'

You can also user Jenkins Credential ID instead of username and password:

def server = Artifactory.newServer url: 'artifactory-url', credentialsId: 'credential'

You can modify the server object using the following methods:

server.bypassProxy = true
// If you're using username and password:
server.username = 'new-user-name'
server.password = 'new-password'
// If you're using Credentials ID:
server.credentialsId = 'credential'

Getting URL'S :

def  url= """{
 "files": [
  {
      url:'artifactory-url'
    }
 ]
}"""

To Get The Url here is the below syntax:

server.getJSON(url);
